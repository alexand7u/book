How to write beutiful code
==========================

So, this is a stupidly written, dumb, __unedited__, and fairly lazy book on how to make your code look awesome and be readable by other people!

Anyways...This book is written in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). And well, even though I'm not too familiar I like it's minimalism.
So...This book won't really have much structer too it.
